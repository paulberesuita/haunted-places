# Growth Strategy

Ideas and tactics for growing SpookFinder visibility.

---

## Cold Email Campaigns

### 1. Ghost Tour Operators (High Priority)
**Why:** Hundreds of small businesses, always looking for exposure, likely to share/link back.

**Find them:**
- Search "ghost tour [city]" for each major city (Savannah, New Orleans, Salem, St. Augustine, etc.)
- Yelp/TripAdvisor listings
- Local tourism board directories

**Pitch angle:**
> "We feature [City] haunted places on SpookFinder and link to local tours. Want to verify your listing info or suggest any spots we're missing?"

**Template:**
```
Subject: Your ghost tour on SpookFinder

Hi [Name],

I run SpookFinder.com - a directory of haunted places across America. We have [X] locations listed in [City], including [notable place].

I wanted to reach out because:
1. We'd love to link to your tour from our [City] page
2. If any info is wrong or you know spots we're missing, let me know

Here's our [City] page: [link]

Cheers,
Paul
```

### 2. Travel/Paranormal Bloggers (Medium Priority)
**Why:** Always need content ideas, may link as a source.

**Find them:**
- Search "haunted places [state] blog"
- Look for medium-sized blogs (not huge publications, not dead sites)

**Pitch angle:**
> "Resource for your next haunted places article"

**Template:**
```
Subject: Source for haunted [State] content

Hi [Name],

Loved your piece on [specific article]. I run SpookFinder - we've researched 750+ haunted locations with ghost stories, coordinates, and historical context.

If you ever need data for a haunted places piece, feel free to use us as a source. Our [State] page has [X] locations: [link]

No ask here - just wanted to share in case it's useful.

Paul
```

### 3. Paranormal Podcasts (Medium Priority)
**Why:** Always need episode topics, niche audience that cares.

**Find them:**
- Search "paranormal podcast" on Spotify/Apple Podcasts
- Look for shows with 50-500 reviews (big enough to matter, small enough to respond)

**Pitch angle:**
> "Episode ideas with lesser-known haunted spots"

**Template:**
```
Subject: 5 haunted spots for an episode

Hi [Name],

Big fan of [Podcast Name]. I run SpookFinder.com and thought you might like these lesser-known spots for a future episode:

1. [Place] - [one-line hook]
2. [Place] - [one-line hook]
3. [Place] - [one-line hook]

Full details with ghost stories here: [link]

Keep up the great work,
Paul

### 4. State/Local Tourism Boards (Low Priority, High Value)
**Why:** Official links = SEO gold. But slow, bureaucratic.

**Targets:**
- Louisiana Office of Tourism (big on haunted trails)
- Visit Savannah
- Destination Salem
- St. Augustine tourism board

**Pitch angle:**
> "Free resource for your haunted tourism initiatives"
