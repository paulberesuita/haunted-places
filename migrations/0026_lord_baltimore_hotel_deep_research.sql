  ghost_story = 'The Lord Baltimore Hotel opened on December 30, 1928, designed by renowned architect William Lee Stoddart in French Renaissance style. At 289 feet and 22 stories, it was the tallest building in Maryland. Owner Harry Busick had spent two decades acquiring capital after the 1904 Great Fire destroyed his previous Caswell House. The grand opening was broadcast live on WBAL radio with Governor Albert Richie and Mayor William F. Broening in attendance. The hotel quickly became a destination for luminaries including Babe Ruth during his last Baltimore visit in 1948, Amelia Earhart, and Olivia De Havilland during press for "Gone with the Wind."

Less than a year after opening, the stock market crashed on October 24-29, 1929, triggering the Great Depression. Because the Lord Baltimore was the tallest building in Baltimore, it became a tragic destination for those who had lost everything. Over 22 documented suicides occurred, with victims jumping from the 19th floor rooftop deck between 1929 and 1932. Documented deaths included Gertrude Merriken in 1931 and Guy P. Clifton in 1933.

The most famous ghost is seven-year-old Molly, whose parents lost their fortune in the crash. The family reportedly stayed at the hotel the weekend after, spending their last moments of luxury together before jumping from the rooftop. Whether Molly perished with them or was left behind remains disputed, but her spirit is seen continuously on the 19th floor wearing a cream-colored dress and black shoes, bouncing a red ball. Guests hear her crying and searching for her parents. Hotel supervisor Frank Carter witnessed Molly''s ghost alongside two adult apparitions—believed to be her parents, who are seen dancing in the ballroom. A painting of Molly now hangs on the 19th floor, considered the hotel''s most haunted area.

A mysterious handprint of a small child appeared on a wall in one of the penthouses and cannot be removed, no matter how many times staff try to clean it—as if Molly is leaving her mark. Long-time food and beverage employee Deborah Davis, who has worked at the hotel for 39 years, reports hearing "knock, knock, knock" and telling the spirit, "Molly, I''m not playing today." The elevator randomly travels to the 19th floor without being called, opening to reveal no one. Guests have reported icy hands touching them in the elevator and lobby.

Another spirit is the Heartbroken Bride who died in Room 1910 on May 19, 1934. Jilted at the altar by Charles Whitmore, she checked into the honeymoon suite still wearing her wedding dress and took an overdose of sleeping pills. A housekeeper saw her standing at the hallway window two weeks after her death before watching her fade away. In 1935, a businessman reported a woman in white knocking on his door around 11 PM asking about Charles, then vanishing impossibly down the corridor. A 2010 bride saw her silhouette at the window of Room 1910 and screamed; the figure vanished. Guests continue to report her asking about her lost fiancé.

The Calvert Ballroom hosts ghostly dancers—a spectral couple waltzing beneath antique crystal chandeliers. Night security has reported seeing dozens of translucent couples in 1940s clothing dancing to phantom big band music around 2 AM in locked, empty ballrooms. These dancers "do not like to be bothered" and grow angry when disturbed. On the mezzanine level, a woman quarrels with her lovers in a "love triangle of the long-dead."

Behind a hidden mirrored door in the Versailles Ballroom lies a Prohibition-era speakeasy where a madam''s ghost inhabits the space where she once ran a brothel. Paranormal investigators have made connections with spirits in this intimate space. Front desk clerk Mark W. witnessed three beer bottles fly across the bar. Staff regularly hear orchestral and jazz music from the Crystal Ballroom when no events are scheduled and rooms are locked.

A well-dressed Gentleman Guide in 1930s-1940s formal wear helps lost guests find their rooms before vanishing. A 2016 guest described being hopelessly lost, receiving directions from him, then finding him gone when turning around. Throughout the hotel, guests and staff see figures "dressed out of fashion, period inappropriate clothing" on the mezzanine and in the LB Tavern who disappear into nothing when pointed out.

The hotel underwent major renovations in 1982 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places that same year. Paranormal activity reportedly increased significantly after the renovations disturbed the building. The Rubell family acquired and renovated the property in 2013, restoring it to its original glory. Today, the hotel embraces its haunted reputation, offering ghost tours through Poe''s Magic Theatre led by entertainment producer Vince Wilson and the Mystical TeAnna.',
