Listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the only Texas property named among Conde Nast Traveler''s 30 most haunted places in America. Pope John Paul II visited in 1987 - his only trip to Texas. The remains of Alamo defenders may be buried within its walls.', 'The hauntings intensified during 1936 renovations when workers discovered long-buried bones and timeworn military uniforms believed to belong to Alamo soldiers. As was tradition, past priests and parishioners were buried within the walls and beneath the floors. Shadowy figures and spectral faces appear suddenly in the cathedral walls. A man dressed entirely in 18th or 19th-century black clothing follows ghost tours, then simply disappears. Figures in hooded, monk-like robes drift through corridors. A white stallion has been spotted walking outside the Cathedral at night. Visitors report cold spots during mass, mysterious lights on the walls, and whispers from nowhere.', 1731, 'https://ghostcitytours.com/san-antonio/haunted-places/san-fernando-cathedral/'),

The current incarnation opened in the 1980s in the former Leon & H. Blum Co. Building. Galveston''s Great Storm of 1900 claimed over 6,000 lives, and during storms, the hotel''s paranormal activity intensifies.', 'The most popular ghost is a Civil War soldier who marches through the front lobby, rhythmically stepping past the elevator shaft, turning toward the front desk, then back again. His boots clack and clatter across the floor even when he cannot be seen. "Lucky Man" Sam was murdered in his sleep after winning big at gambling, his winnings and life stolen the same night. He drags himself through the hotel with a limp, identified by one-footed plodding and unexplained knocks. Young Jimmy, killed in an automobile accident, haunts the back alley and elevators - knock three times on elevator doors and get three knocks back.

Designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1977 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.', 'The 1970s renovations awakened spirits that had long been dormant. A lady in white with a flowing lace gown appears on the landing of the grand staircase. A man in tennis clothes with a handlebar mustache has been spotted throughout the mansion. Phantom orchestra music, singing, and dancing emanate from the third-floor ballroom. In 1989, a security officer encountered a woman on the stairs who asked "have you seen my husband?" When he noticed her legs faded into nothing - she had no feet - he stood paralyzed as she walked past him and vanished. Employees catch unexplained whiffs of fresh flowers, perhaps connected to Electra, who required daily fresh flower deliveries.', 1904, 'https://ghostcitytours.com/fort-worth/haunted-fort-worth/wharton-scott-house/'),

The building has witnessed multiple tragic deaths, and at least four different spirits are said to inhabit its rooms.', 'Elizabeth was found dead in the house in the early 1920s, murdered by strangulation on her wedding day. Caroline Moody died here at age 80 - a devout Baptist who disapproved of alcohol, she began breaking wine glasses when the restaurant got its liquor license. Lola Roller was killed by an ex-lover a few blocks away but haunts here anyway. Will stands on the front porch in bib overalls and vanishes when approached. A broken clock still occasionally chimes, doors unlock themselves, lights and faucets turn on alone, and refrigerator doors open and close by invisible hands. Kitchen burners ignite without lighters. Shadow figures appear in the men''s restroom mirror. Though the restaurant has closed, the ghosts remain.', 1895, 'https://dallasterrors.com/the-catfish-plantation-restaurant/'),

The ornate lobby and grand ballrooms have witnessed countless celebrations and, apparently, some tragedies that keep spirits lingering within its walls.', 'Guests and staff report unexplained phenomena throughout the historic hotel, including cold spots, flickering lights, and the feeling of being watched. The grand staircase is a hotspot for activity, with figures in period clothing spotted ascending or descending before vanishing. Some guests have reported waking to find spectral figures at the foot of their beds. The hotel''s long history of hosting powerful and wealthy guests means many souls may have formed attachments to this luxurious property they never wanted to leave.', 1909, 'https://www.hauntedrooms.com/texas/san-antonio/haunted-places/haunted-hotels'),

Listed as a National Historic Landmark, the Palace represents Spanish colonial rule over Texas and the grandeur of that era.', 'The centuries of Spanish colonial history have left spiritual residue within these thick adobe walls. Visitors report the sensation of being watched, cold spots in warm rooms, and the sound of Spanish being spoken when no one is there.

Some believe the spirits of Spanish officials and their families still walk the courtyard and chambers of their former home, overseeing a territory they ruled nearly 300 years ago.', 1749, 'https://ghostcitytours.com/san-antonio/haunted-places/'),

After falling into disrepair, it was restored and reopened in 2006.', 'El Paso leads the nation in ghost sightings, and the Plaza Theatre is one of its most haunted venues. Staff working late report seeing figures in the balcony that disappear when approached. Footsteps echo through empty corridors, and the sounds of a phantom audience can sometimes be heard - laughter, applause, and conversation from shows that ended decades ago. The projection booth is particularly active, with equipment turning on by itself and the presence of someone watching those below.', 1930, 'https://kisselpaso.com/el-paso-urban-legends/'),

Guests report encounters with spectral ranchers and cowboys from the property''s past. Some rooms are known for unexplained activity - lights flickering, objects moving, and the feeling of an unseen presence. The ghost of a woman has been spotted in the hallways, and staff have heard footsteps in empty rooms.

However, it is also reportedly the most haunted place in Waco, with Jacob''s Ladder - a steep staircase cut into the cliff - being particularly notorious for paranormal activity.', 'Legend tells of a ghostly entity named "Grabby" who allegedly murdered dozens of pregnant women and threw them into the Brazos River. At Jacob''s Ladder, visitors are poked and grabbed by phantom hands as they climb.

The jail held prisoners in conditions typical of the era, and many inmates died within its walls. The conversion to a hotel did not drive away the spirits of former inmates.', 'Guests at this hotel report the ghosts of former prisoners still roaming the halls. Cold spots appear without explanation, doors slam by themselves, and some guests wake to find spectral figures standing in their rooms. The energy of incarceration and the desperation of those who died here seems to have seeped into the building itself. Some visitors feel overwhelming sadness or anxiety in certain areas, as if experiencing residual emotions from the jail''s dark past.', 1878, 'https://alamocityghosttours.com/holiday-inn-express-riverwalk/'),

She appears during storms and on the anniversary of the disaster, her anguished cries audible to those passing by. The building itself has reported activity, with workers seeing figures in the halls and elevators operating on their own. The trauma of surviving the tornado while so many died may have left spiritual energy clinging to this sole survivor of downtown Waco.', 1911, 'https://www.kwbu.org/news/2023-10-27/wacos-haunted-heritage-pt-2');
