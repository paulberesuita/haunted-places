Listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1982, it has been called "The Most Haunted House in Ohio" and has been featured on Ghost Adventures and Paranormal Lockdown.', 'The Tiedemann family suffered tremendous tragedy within these walls, losing multiple children in infancy, a 15-year-old daughter, and eventually Mrs. Tiedemann herself. Tales of haunting began in the 1960s when the Romano family moved in and their children encountered a crying girl in white on the third floor. The family reported haunting organ music, heavy footfalls, and faces appearing in woodwork. Rumors swirl of a niece hanged in a secret tunnel, a strangled mistress, and a murdered servant girl. Human bones were found in a closet in 1975. Today, overnight stays are offered for those brave enough to sleep where so many spirits reportedly dwell.', 1883, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Castle'),

Squire, Vice President of Standard Oil Company under John D. Rockefeller. Squire purchased 525 acres in the beautiful Chagrin Valley with plans to build an English baronial estate, but only the gatehouse was ever completed. After his wife reportedly became unhappy with the isolated location, Squire abandoned his plans. The structure became part of Cleveland Metroparks in 1925 and is now a popular hiking destination.', 'Legend tells that Louisa Squire, prone to insomnia during stays at the property, would take nighttime walks through the castle. One fateful night, she entered the trophy room and caught sight of a terrifying apparition reflected in one of the hunting trophies - or perhaps just her own lantern''s reflection. Whatever she saw shocked her so profoundly that she lost her footing on the stairs and fell to her death. Her ghost is said to still wander the castle, appearing as a woman in white holding a lantern. Visitors have reported seeing a red light moving through windows and feeling an eerie presence, though historical records show Louisa actually died of natural causes in Wickliffe years later.', 1897, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squire%27s_Castle'),

The grounds feature stunning Gothic architecture, elaborate monuments, and serene lakes throughout.', 'The cemetery''s most haunting feature is the Haserot Angel, officially "The Angel of Death Victorious," created by sculptor Herman Matzen in 1924. The bronze angel sits upon a marble throne with outstretched wings, holding an extinguished torch. Due to weathering, black streaks run from her eyes down her face, giving the haunting appearance of weeping. Visitors claim her eyes follow them as they pass, and some have reported hearing faint crying near the grave. The spirit of Eliot Ness, whose ashes were scattered in one of the cemetery''s lakes, reportedly still patrols the grounds, perhaps eternally hunting bootleggers. Other visitors report shadowy figures among the tombstones and an overwhelming sense of being watched.', 1869, 'https://www.lakeviewcemetery.com/'),

The imposing structure housed over 150,000 inmates during its operation until 1990, when a federal court ordered it closed due to overcrowding and inhumane conditions. The prison is famous as the filming location for The Shawshank Redemption and has been featured on numerous paranormal television shows including Ghost Hunters and Ghost Adventures.', 'More than 200 people died within these walls, including two guards, and their spirits are said to still roam the cellblocks. A guard killed in Solitary Confinement in 1932 reportedly still makes his rounds, jabbing visitors with his nightstick and pushing guests. Shadow people are frequently seen in the six-tier East Cell Block, the largest freestanding steel cell block in the world. Visitors experience footsteps, disembodied voices, whispers, and physical contact including hair pulling and scratching. The warden''s wife was accidentally killed in her quarters when a handgun discharged from a jewelry box shelf, and her spirit is said to linger in the administrative wing.

The area''s dark reputation stems from a combination of historical facts that have been woven into ghost stories over generations. The actual Light of Hope Orphanage operated on this road from 1902 until reports of abuse led to its closure. The nearby Swift Mansion, home to a family that held seances and lost four children to diphtheria, added to the location''s eerie reputation.', 'Legend claims that an orphanage burned down in the 1800s, killing dozens of children whose screaming ghosts can still be heard on dark nights. Visitors report ghostly apparitions, mysterious balls of light, children''s handprints appearing on dusty car windows, and the haunting screams of children echoing through the woods. While historians note that no children actually died in any fire at the orphanage, the atmosphere along this dark country road is undeniably unsettling. The high-pitched hum of trucks crossing a nearby Ohio Turnpike bridge often carries on the wind, creating sounds easily mistaken for ghostly wails. Whether the legends are true or embellished, Gore Orphanage Road remains a popular destination for legend-tripping teenagers and paranormal investigators alike.', 1902, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gore_Orphanage'),

The property includes a beautiful lake, golf course, and extensive hiking trails through the surrounding Geauga County countryside.', 'Guests at Punderson Manor frequently report strange and unexplained occurrences throughout the historic lodge. Doors open and close by themselves, faucets turn on and off without human intervention, and creepy disembodied laughter echoes through empty hallways. Some guests have reported seeing shadowy figures passing through walls or standing at the foot of their beds at night. The identity of the spirits haunting the manor remains unknown, though speculation centers on former residents or guests who may have died on the property. Staff members have grown accustomed to the paranormal activity, considering the ghosts harmless if somewhat mischievous permanent residents.', 1929, 'https://www.hauntedrooms.com/ohio/haunted-places/haunted-hotels'),

Throughout the building, other nuns have been sighted wandering the halls, perhaps continuing their devotions from beyond the grave. Late at night, the sound of piano music drifts through the empty corridors, though no one is playing. Doors slam shut on their own, cold spots appear without explanation, and visitors report feeling watched by unseen presences. The combination of the building''s religious history and the intensity of devotion practiced within its walls may explain why so many spirits seem reluctant to leave.', 1905, 'https://www.buckeyebroadband.com/blog/must-visit-ohio-haunted-places');

One sister, Martha Hartway, stayed with the family and eventually married the Kelton family butler. The home remained in the Kelton family until Grace Bird Kelton''s death in 1975.', 'Since renovations began, unexplained phenomena have occurred regularly throughout the house. Interior doors open at night when the building is empty, furniture moves on its own, and apparitions in period attire appear and vanish. Oscar Kelton, Fernando''s son killed in the Civil War, has been seen in the garden wearing his gray uniform and smoking a cigar. Staff have smelled women''s perfume when alone, attributed to the spirit of Grace Kelton. Grace is particularly active, reportedly reorganizing files that staff have arranged, hiding items in locked cabinets, and leaving out cleaning supplies when housework doesn''t meet her standards. Guests report being pushed or pulled in upstairs hallways. Each Halloween, Fernando''s Victorian funeral is reenacted in the parlor where it originally occurred.', 1852, 'https://keltonhouse.com/'),

She appears most frequently in the stairwell, visible only from the corner of one''s eye before vanishing when looked at directly. She has also been spotted wandering the hallways, perhaps searching for something or someone long lost. In one particularly disturbing incident, a hotel security guard named Kevin heard a woman''s horrific screaming on the second floor in the middle of the afternoon. He frantically searched the area for twenty minutes but could find no explanation for the terrifying sounds. The identity of the Lady of the Lofts remains a mystery, though some speculate she may have been an employee of one of the businesses that occupied the building during its early years.', 1882, 'https://heritageohio.org/haunted-ohio-hotels/'),

The Victorian home now serves as a literary museum and center, hosting writing programs, readings, and events.

However, staff and visitors report that the hauntings are no joke. Footsteps are heard on stairs when no one is present, doors open and close on their own, and strange shadows move through rooms. Some have reported seeing a figure resembling Thurber himself, still wandering the halls of his former home. The proximity to the old asylum cemetery has led some to speculate that restless spirits from that dark period of medical history may also visit the property.

The Schmidt family has operated the business for generations, maintaining their traditional recipes and Bavarian atmosphere.', 'The friendly ghost at Schmidt''s has been affectionately dubbed "Grandpa" by staff who have encountered him over the years. The general manager once heard a loud noise and discovered four chairs mysteriously sitting back-to-back in the middle of an otherwise empty room. Even more startling, when he looked at a wall mirror, he saw the reflection of an elderly man smiling and waving at him - though he was completely alone. Grandpa seems to enjoy watching over the restaurant, perhaps a former owner or beloved employee who couldn''t bear to leave. His presence is considered benevolent, and staff have come to accept their spectral coworker as part of the Schmidt''s family.', 1886, 'https://614now.com/2025/food-drink/travel-guide-names-8-notoriously-haunted-ohio-restaurants-to-try-and-two-are-here-in-central-ohio'),

On a snowy February night long ago, this barefoot woman confronted Pritchard in front of The Clock restaurant and stabbed him; he later died on the restaurant floor from his wounds. Every year on the anniversary of his death, visitors claim to see her footprints appearing in the snow outside the building, as if she has returned to relive her moment of deadly vengeance. Inside, staff and patrons report cold spots, flickering lights, and the unsettling feeling of being watched. Some have glimpsed a woman in period dress moving through the restaurant before vanishing.

A guard at the bottom of the stairs never saw her come down. Some believe she was murdered and removed in a trunk. To this day, her spirit graces the theater, leaving behind the sweet scent of rose perfume. Footsteps and the rustling of her petticoat cross the stage, lights flicker mysteriously, and elevator doors open by themselves. During renovations in 1979, workers complained of tools constantly disappearing. The face of a man who committed suicide has been seen on backstage curtains.

In the Big House itself, tour guests have reported sudden feelings of overwhelming sadness, while staff hear glasses breaking and doors closing when no one else is present. Louis Bromfield himself has been spotted watching tours, apparently pleased that his beloved farm continues to educate visitors. USA Today recognized Malabar Farm as one of the nation''s most haunted locations.', 1939, 'https://www.ohiocoopliving.com/things-go-bump-night'),

It operated as the Masonic Opera House from 1876 until becoming the Majestic Theatre in 1915, hosting performers including Milton Berle, Sophie Tucker, and Laurel and Hardy. The theater''s most tragic chapter came during the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic, when it served as a temporary morgue for victims from nearby Camp Sherman.', 'During the Spanish Flu outbreak, when nearly 1,200 people died at Camp Sherman, the Majestic Theatre''s stage was used for embalming, with bodies stacked in dressing rooms waiting their turn. Blood drained from the bodies flowed into "Bank Alley" behind the theater, which became known as "Blood Alley." The ghosts of flu victims now walk the theater. A man in a dark suit and top hat floats down the aisles, walking a few feet above the current floor level where the original floor once was. The apparition of a dead soldier has been seen lying on the stage during performances. A little girl in an old-fashioned dress appears in the audience, giggling at comedies and crying during sad scenes before vanishing when approached, leaving only the faint smell of peppermint candy. A ghost in blue has a favorite seat and reacts badly when living patrons sit there. Actors have seen someone peering down from the empty control booth.', 1853, 'https://www.ohioexploration.com/paranormal/investigations/inv-majestictheatre/');

  ('oliver-house', 'The Oliver House', 'Toledo', '27 Broadway Street', 'OH', 41.6531, -83.5336, 'restaurant', 'The Oliver House is the oldest building in downtown Toledo, originally opened as a hotel by William Oliver in 1859. Renowned American architect Isaiah Rogers designed the elegant structure. During the Spanish-American War, the building served as a medical center for wounded soldiers. The basement contains a bricked-over archway - the entrance to a tunnel once used to transport escaped slaves to boats on the Maumee River bound for Canada. Today, the building houses the Maumee Bay Brewing Company.', 'Multiple spirits haunt the Oliver House. The most frequently seen is "The Captain," a soldier in full military uniform who appears throughout the building, believed to be from the Spanish-American War era when wounded men were treated here. Staff describe him as a benign, jovial spirit who seems pleased with renovations to his former hospital. A woman in a white dress also appears to guests and diners. Perhaps most significant is the discovery of a Native American burial ground beneath the property - when renovations disturbed a warrior chief''s grave, a tribe from the west was brought to perform a reburial ceremony. A protective female spirit guards the restaurant area, while a murdered servant woman and the ghosts of children running through the banquet room have also been reported. The smell of cigar smoke drifts through rooms where no one is smoking.', 1859, 'https://mbaybrew.com/about-us/the-oliver-house-building/'),

The cemetery is home to elaborate Victorian monuments and mausoleums, including the striking pyramid marking the grave of John Gunckel, founder of the Toledo Newsboys Association. The 26-foot pyramid weighing an estimated 1,000 tons has become an iconic landmark and popular destination for both history buffs and paranormal investigators.', 'The most famous apparition at Woodlawn Cemetery is the Woman in White, a ghostly figure who creeps around the cemetery gates at night, searching for her lost daughter. She has been seen during both day and night, approaching visitors to ask if they have seen her child. Her desperation is palpable, and her eternal search is heartbreaking to witness. Mysterious photographs have been captured around the Gunckel pyramid, showing strange lights and ghostly figures not visible to the naked eye. The cemetery''s Victorian-era atmosphere and elaborate monuments create an appropriately somber setting for its supernatural inhabitants. Visitors report cold spots, the feeling of being followed, and glimpses of figures among the headstones that vanish when approached directly.', 1876, 'https://www.ourhauntedtravels.com/post/woman-in-white-woodlawn-cemetery-toledo'),

W. Yost and opened in 1889. Built of pink sandstone quarried near Millersburg, the castle-like building housed both the sheriff''s family in its front quarters and prisoners in 32 cells in the rear. The jail remained operational until 1987 and is linked to at least 22 confirmed deaths, including three sheriffs and 19 inmates.', 'The jail''s most dramatic historical event was the lynching of detective Carl Etherington in 1909. Etherington, an Anti-Saloon League detective, shot a local saloon owner in self-defense and was taken to the jail for protection. A mob stormed the building, dragged him out, and hanged him from a telephone pole on the courthouse square - 58 participants were later indicted. His spirit and those of other violent deaths echo through the building. The "dungeon" area is a paranormal hotspot where visitors are touched, have their clothes tugged, and have witnessed heavy chairs thrown across rooms by invisible forces. Full apparitions have been seen, and bone-chilling EVP recordings capture disembodied voices, chanting, and cell doors slamming. Ghost Adventures featured the jail in 2014, bringing national attention to this actively haunted location. The building now hosts ghost hunts and the seasonal Jail of Terror haunted attraction.', 1889, 'https://www.hauntedrooms.com/ohio/haunted-places/old-licking-county-jail-newark');

Built by Orrin Granger, the Federal-style building also served as Granville''s first post office and a stagecoach stop on the Columbus-Newark route. The inn has hosted travelers for over two centuries, maintaining its historic character with antique furnishings, working fireplaces, and renowned dining. Major Horton Buxton, who purchased the inn in 1865, gave the establishment its current name.', 'The Buxton Inn is rumored to have numerous ghosts, with paranormal activity reported since the 1930s. Orrin Granger, the original builder, has been seen on the property, perhaps checking on his creation. Major Horton Buxton also returns to his namesake inn. Rooms 7 and 9 are considered the most paranormally active. Room 9 is haunted by Bonnie Bounell, a former innkeeper who died there and is known as "The Lady in Blue" - guests report seeing her apparition, feeling cold spots, and sensing her watchful presence. Room 7 contains a darker, more shadowy entity that some find unsettling. Adding to the inn''s spectral population is a ghost cat that has been spotted prowling the hallways. The combination of the inn''s great age, the many lives lived within its walls, and the devoted innkeepers who never left makes the Buxton Inn one of Ohio''s most actively haunted destinations.', 1812, 'https://www.hauntedrooms.com/ohio/haunted-places/haunted-hotels'),

Founded by abolitionists, the tavern served as an important station on the Underground Railroad, with a secret tunnel leading from the property to the basement where escaped slaves could hide during daylight hours. The inn has been carefully restored and offers fine dining and historic accommodations.', 'The most heartbreaking ghost at the Spread Eagle Tavern is that of an eight-year-old enslaved girl who died in a fire sometime in the 1800s while hiding on the property. Her spirit runs through the inn, playing and exploring as children do. Guests and staff have heard her footsteps, glimpsed her small figure darting around corners, and felt her curious presence. The tragedy of her death - so close to freedom, hiding from those who would return her to bondage - makes her haunting particularly poignant. Other spirits connected to the Underground Railroad may also remain, drawn to the place that represented hope and sanctuary. The secret tunnel on the property adds to the inn''s atmosphere of mystery and hidden history, a physical reminder of the desperate journeys that passed through these walls.', 1837, 'https://unearththevoyage.com/ohio-haunted-restaurants-spooky-dining-halloween-guide/');
