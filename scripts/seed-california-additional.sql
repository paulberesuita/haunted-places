The Travel Channel''s Ghost Adventures filmed an episode here.', 'The most famous ghost is ten-year-old Sarah Logan, niece of original owner Judge James Harvey Logan, who drowned in the creek in 1918 - the same creek that now runs through the dining room. Crying Sarah has approached guests asking for help finding her nanny before vanishing. Psychic Sylvia Browne recognized more than sixty spirits trapped on the property. In the Brook Room, glowing orbs and flashes of light fly around at night. The Mermaid Room, closed since 1972 after a 13-year-old girl drowned in the pool, has a jukebox that turns itself on, and soft voices and clinking glasses are heard from the empty room. Guests report figures walking on elevated bridges that no longer exist and sounds of footsteps above top-floor rooms.', 1890, 'https://lookout.co/brookdale-lodge-haunted-halloween-sarah-logan-santa-cruz-county'),

By 1932, it had earned a sinister name: Suicide Bridge. More than 150 people have ended their lives here, with around 50 occurring during the Great Depression.

A suicide barrier was added in 1993.', 'The first suicide occurred on November 16, 1919. The first tragedy actually happened during construction when a worker fell into wet concrete and was left there when coworkers couldn''t save him in time. In 1937, a despondent mother threw her baby over the railing before following - miraculously, the child survived though the mother did not. Spectral figures now wander the bridge and canyon. A man in wire-rimmed glasses is often seen. A woman in a flowing robe appears atop a parapet before throwing herself off and vanishing.

The Ohlone people were largely buried in unmarked graves here, laying an early foundation for its haunted reputation.', 'San Francisco National Cemetery is one of the most active paranormal locations. Visitors see figures in uniform walking among the gravestones. The sound of taps - played at military funerals - is heard when no bugler is present. Union spy Pauline Cushman''s ghost walks the cemetery in her theatrical costumes. At the former Letterman Hospital, demolished in 2002, staff swore the hospital was haunted per a 1992 Army inspection report. Youth breaking in heard patients shuffling, voices calling from behind closed doors, and saw dark figures. A Muni bus driver reported a uniformed soldier who boarded late at night and vanished before leaving the Presidio.

The scenic spot is marked with a sign acknowledging its haunted reputation.', 'The "Lady in Lace" has been blamed for collisions along the twisting, foggy 17-Mile Drive for over 150 years. After Maria del Carmen''s death in 1856, people began reporting sightings of a mysterious woman in a white lace wedding gown.

It is one of California''s oldest and most remote lighthouses, built to guide ships along the treacherous Big Sur coast.

Ghost Adventures filmed an episode at this haunted lighthouse.', 'As many as 20 ghosts are claimed to haunt Point Sur, identified through EVP recordings by docent and ghost hunter Julie Nunes. Ruth''s spirit lingers in the kitchen she loved, often closing doors in the restored 1950s room.

An apparition in a black robe sits in the judge''s chair and walks around the courtroom. (Though interestingly, the legend may have started when janitors misread a plaque reading "Judge Morrison Clock/Hung in courtroom/1985" and thought a judge had hanged himself.) Paranormal investigator Ernie Alonso recorded employees describing dread, fear, and choking sensations in certain rooms. The basement, where violently insane offenders were once kept, produces the strongest feelings of fear. Investigators have captured sounds of a child crying and unexplained scents during investigations.', 1901, 'https://www.hauntedrooms.com/california/orange-county/haunted-places'),

Whether Marcy''s spirit lingers at the site of her death or the area simply absorbed the trauma of that terrible crime, Marsh Road remains a place locals approach with caution after dark.', 1981, 'https://www.metrosiliconvalley.com/the-23-most-haunted-places-in-the-silicon-valley/'),
