On March 6, 1836, Mexican forces under General Santa Anna overwhelmed the 200 Texan defenders in a 90-minute battle that killed everyone inside, including legendary frontiersmen Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie. Before the battle, the site served as the city cemetery, holding at least a thousand bodies beneath its soil.', 'The hauntings began days after the battle when General Santa Anna ordered the church burned. Soldiers sent to carry out the command encountered six ghostly figures carrying flaming swords - "diablos" they called them - guarding the site. Terrified, they fled and refused to return. Today, visitors report seeing phantom soldiers marching the grounds, shadowy figures disappearing into walls, and a little blond boy peering from the gift shop''s upper left window, believed to be searching for parents who died in battle. When the Alamo served as a police jail, guards refused night shifts due to moans so loud they woke prisoners.

The hotel essentially sits on old Alamo battleground land, which may explain why it has accumulated at least 32 documented spirits.', 'Teddy Roosevelt''s ghost still recruits at the Menger Bar, appearing as a nearly translucent figure and sometimes engaging staff in conversation about joining the cavalry. Sallie White, a beloved chambermaid murdered by her jealous husband in 1876, was shot twice while fleeing to the hotel. She died on the third floor, where guests now see her ghost clutching towels or walking through walls. Captain Richard King, the cattle baron who founded the King Ranch, died of stomach cancer in his private suite on April 14, 1885.

The terra cotta gargoyles depicting medical ailments hint at its original purpose. The building''s most haunted floors - the 7th, 9th, and 14th (actually the 13th) - housed the psychiatric ward, surgical suites, waiting areas, and morgue. The hotel stands on the exact location of the Alamo''s long barracks, where hundreds of soldiers perished.', 'Phones ring in the middle of the night with no one on the line.

The hotel is named for Davy Crockett, the legendary frontiersman who died defending the Alamo. Its location on former battleground adds to its mysterious and supernatural reputation.', 'The proximity to the Alamo means guests encounter the spirits of fallen defenders who wander between the hotel and the former mission. Visitors report cold spots in hallways, the sensation of being watched, and glimpses of men in period clothing who fade away when approached. Some guests wake in the night to shadowy figures standing at the foot of their beds.

During construction, workers uncovered two cannons used during the famous 1836 battle, and as soon as the artifacts were removed to museums across the city, the hauntings began.', 'The building has been haunted since the cannons were disturbed. Guests and staff report seeing soldiers in 19th-century uniforms wandering the halls. Cold spots appear without explanation, and the sound of cannon fire has been heard in the dead of night. Some visitors feel overwhelming sadness in certain areas of the hotel, believed to be residual energy from the massacre that occurred on this ground nearly 200 years ago.

The mission served as a religious and educational center for Native Americans before secularization in 1824.', 'A dark-robed priest, sometimes appearing headless, haunts Mission San Jose and has been witnessed by countless visitors over the decades. A large black dog roams the courtyard at night - believed by many to be a Native American spirit taking animal form. Visitors report seeing the ghostly apparition of a Spanish soldier pacing restlessly across the courtyard, forever on guard.

One volunteer claims to have seen a man dressed as a conquistador who almost immediately disappeared into thin air. Spanish soldiers on horseback have been spotted galloping across the mission''s courtyard. A wolf-like animal dragging chains has been reported, along with a converted Native American man seen praying at the altar.

The state asylums dropped terms like "insane" and "lunatic" from their names in 1925. The hospital witnessed decades of controversial treatments and tragic deaths, including patients wrongfully committed for years.', 'Investigators brave enough to enter report screaming, moaning, doors slamming shut, and footsteps echoing through empty corridors, especially in the disciplinary unit. Shadow people move through the halls, and cries for help echo from nowhere. The story of William Browne haunts the hospital - a man committed in 1898 without proper examination and held for twelve years until a judge finally freed him. He was murdered just six years later near Brownsville, where his own brother was mayor.

For decades, San Antonians have visited to park on the tracks, put their cars in neutral, sprinkle baby powder on their bumpers, and wait for ghost children to push them to safety, leaving tiny handprints as proof.', 'The legend says that if you park your car on the tracks and shift into neutral, the ghosts of the dead children will push your vehicle uphill to safety. Thousands of visitors have reported their cars moving on their own, and many claim to find small handprints in the baby powder on their vehicles. The nearby streets were said to be named for the victims. Though the actual accident happened in Utah in 1938, and the phenomenon is likely an optical illusion caused by a slight incline, the legend persists. Union Pacific modified the tracks in 2018, but the ghost children remain part of San Antonio folklore.', 1940, 'https://ghostcitytours.com/san-antonio/haunted-places/haunted-railroad-tracks/');

When she learned his vessel had sunk, she hanged herself in despair. Tragically, her fiance had been rescued and returned soon after her death. Guests on the fifth floor feel her chill, hear doors slam, and watch lights flicker. Children''s giggling echoes through corridors - spirits of orphans who died with Sister Katherine in the 1900 storm. The hotel spa, built where an ice cream parlor once stood, is haunted by a girl''s voice whispering "ice cream."
