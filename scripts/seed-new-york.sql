Oscar, an old stagehand, manipulates the lighting system, making lights flicker during performances and rehearsals. Clarissa, an actress who allegedly died falling from the balcony, is the most frequently observed ghost. She has been seen carrying lilacs and has reportedly frightened rock bands smoking in the backstage tunnels. Theater staff hear footsteps in empty areas, doors open and close on their own, and cold spots move through the auditorium. Some performers refuse to go into certain backstage areas alone.

Screaming is commonly heard emanating from the buildings, echoing the cries of those who suffered within. Investigators report cold spots, orbs in photographs, and overwhelming feelings of dread. The spirits seem to be reliving their torment. Some visitors have been physically pushed or scratched by unseen forces. The tragic history of mental health treatment in the 19th and early 20th centuries created a concentration of suffering that left a permanent paranormal residue.', 1843, 'https://www.hauntedrooms.com/new-york/haunted-places');

Five-year-old Missy developed an imaginary friend - a demonic pig-like creature with glowing red eyes named Jodie. When a Catholic priest came to bless the home, he heard a deep voice command "Get out!" and felt slapped across the face. Ed and Lorraine Warren investigated and rated it "a 10" on their scale of hauntings.
