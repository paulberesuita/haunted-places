# Resource Page Link Building: Target List & Playbook

A detailed guide to finding and acquiring links from resource pages in the haunted/paranormal niche.

---

## What Are Resource Pages?

Resource pages are curated lists of links on a specific topic. They exist to help visitors find useful content. Webmasters actively maintain them and are often happy to add quality resources.

**Why they're valuable:**
- Webmaster is already linking out (link-friendly mindset)
- Relevant to your niche (topical authority)
- Often on established sites (domain authority)
- Lower competition than news/PR outreach

## Pro Tips

1. **Check if page is actively maintained** — Look for recent updates or "last updated" date. Dead pages won't add you.

2. **Study existing links** — What sites do they already link to? Match that quality level.

3. **Offer reciprocity** — "Happy to link back to your site" can increase success rate.

4. **Start with smaller sites** — DA 20-40 sites are more responsive than DA 60+ sites.

5. **Personalize genuinely** — Mention something specific about their site. "I noticed you cover [X]" shows you actually visited.

6. **Don't ask for specific anchor text** — Just ask for a link. Specifying anchor text looks spammy.

7. **Be patient** — Webmasters are busy. Response can take 1-2 weeks.

8. **Track domain authority gains** — Use Moz or Ahrefs free tools monthly to see if your DA is climbing.
