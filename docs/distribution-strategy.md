- Low time investment, high credibility if done right

### Target Subreddits

### Content Playbook

**Type 1: Value-First Posts (No Links)**
Post genuinely interesting content without linking to SpookFinder. Build karma and credibility.

```
Title: "I researched the 10 most haunted hotels you can actually stay at tonight"

[Write out the list with brief descriptions]

"Happy to share more details on any of these if anyone's interested."
```

When people ask for more info → share SpookFinder link in comments.

**Type 2: Answer Questions**
Search for posts like:
- "What's the most haunted place in [state]?"
- "Looking for haunted places to visit on my road trip"
- "Best haunted hotels?"

Reply with genuinely helpful answers. Include SpookFinder link naturally:

```
"The Crescent Hotel in Eureka Springs is legit creepy — it was a fake cancer hospital
where a con man killed dozens of patients. I wrote up the full history here: [link]"
```

**Type 3: AMA / Deep Dives**
Once you have karma, post original research:

```
Title: "I've spent 6 months researching every haunted place in North Carolina.
Here's what I found."

[Post the most interesting findings, named ghosts, specific incidents]

"Full research with sources at spookfinder.com/states/north-carolina"
```

### Reddit Rules to Follow

1. **Don't spam** — 90% valuable comments, 10% self-promotion max
2. **Read each sub's rules** — some ban all links, others are lenient
3. **Build karma first** — 500+ karma before posting links
4. **Be a real person** — comment on other posts, have conversations
5. **Never use link shorteners** — Reddit auto-removes them

### Time Investment

- **Week 1-2:** Comment on 3-5 posts/day, build karma, learn community norms
- **Week 3+:** Mix of comments and occasional posts with links
- **Ongoing:** 15-30 min/day

## 2. Pinterest Strategy

### Why Pinterest Works

- Pinterest is a **search engine**, not social media — content compounds over time
- Travel and "bucket list" content performs extremely well
- Pins can drive traffic for years
- SpookFinder's visual potential: creepy buildings, historic photos, maps

### Account Setup

1. **Business account** (free, gives analytics)
2. **Username:** @SpookFinder or @SpookFinderHaunts
3. **Profile:** "Discover America's most haunted places. Deep research on 800+ haunted hotels, cemeteries, and landmarks."
4. **Claim website** for rich pins

### Board Strategy

Create 10-15 boards organized by:

| Board Name | Content |
|------------|---------|
| Haunted Hotels You Can Stay In | Individual hotel pins |
| Most Haunted Places in [State] | State-specific (make one per state) |
| Haunted Road Trip Ideas | Multi-stop itineraries |
| Historic Haunted Houses | Mansions, plantations, historic homes |
| Creepy Cemeteries | Cemetery place pins |
| Ghost Tours Worth Taking | Tour operator content |
| Paranormal History | Historical events, tragedies |
| Spooky Travel Aesthetic | Mood board, atmospheric photos |

### Pin Types That Work

**1. List Pins**
"7 Haunted Places in Savannah That Will Give You Chills"
- Vertical image (2:3 ratio, 1000x1500px)
- Text overlay on image
- Links to state page or listicle

**2. Individual Place Pins**
"The Stanley Hotel — The Hotel That Inspired The Shining"
- Photo of location
- Brief hook in description
- Links to place page

**3. Infographic Pins**
"The Most Haunted City in Each State"
- Map or grid visual
- Highly shareable
- Links to homepage or states page

**4. Quote/Fact Pins**
"Room 217 of the Stanley Hotel is where Stephen King stayed the night that inspired The Shining"
- Simple text on atmospheric background
- Curiosity-driven

### Pin Creation Workflow

**Tools:**
- Canva (free) — templates for Pinterest
- Unsplash/Pexels — free stock photos
- Your own screenshots of SpookFinder pages

**Batch creation:**
1. Pick 5 places
2. Create 2-3 pins per place (different images/angles)
3. Schedule across 1-2 weeks
4. Repeat

**Posting frequency:**
- Minimum: 5 pins/week
- Ideal: 3-5 pins/day (use scheduler)
- Pinterest rewards consistency over volume spikes

### Pinterest SEO

Pinterest is a search engine. Optimize for keywords:

**In Pin Title:**
"Haunted Hotels in New Orleans You Can Book Tonight"

**In Pin Description:**
"Looking for haunted places to stay in New Orleans? The Hotel Monteleone has been
investigated by Ghost Hunters and guests report seeing spirits in the hallways.
Click to read the full ghost story and book your stay. #hauntedhotels #neworleans
#spookytravel #ghosthunting"

**Keyword Research:**
- Type in Pinterest search bar, see autocomplete suggestions
- "Haunted hotels" → "haunted hotels in texas", "haunted hotels near me"
- Target long-tail phrases

### Time Investment

- **Setup:** 2-3 hours (account, boards, first 20 pins)
- **Ongoing:** 2-3 hours/week (batch create + schedule)
- **Results timeline:** 3-6 months to see consistent traffic

## 3. TikTok/Reels Strategy

### Why It Works

- Paranormal content goes viral regularly
- "Haunted places" is a proven TikTok niche
- Can repurpose same content to TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
- One viral video = thousands of new visitors

### Why It's Hard

- Requires video creation (even simple ones)
- Algorithm is unpredictable
- Needs consistency (daily or near-daily posting)
- May not convert to website visits as well as other platforms

### Content Formats That Work

**1. "The Most Haunted Place in [State]"**
- 30-60 second video
- Photo slideshow with voiceover
- End with "Link in bio for the full story"

**2. "3 Haunted Hotels You Can Book Tonight"**
- Quick cuts between locations
- Text overlays with key facts
- Booking angle = high intent

**3. "POV: You're staying at the most haunted hotel in America"**
- Atmospheric, first-person style
- Works even with stock footage

**4. "Things that happened at [Place] that will haunt you"**
- Storytime format
- List of creepy incidents
- Hook in first 2 seconds

### Low-Effort Video Creation

You don't need to visit locations. Create videos with:

1. **Photos from SpookFinder** (screenshots of places)
2. **Stock footage** (Pexels has free creepy clips)
3. **Text overlays** (CapCut, free)
4. **Voiceover** (your voice or AI voice)
5. **Trending audio** (search "creepy" or "scary" sounds)

**Tools:**
- CapCut (free, mobile editing)
- Canva Video (free, simple)
- InShot (free, mobile)

### Posting Strategy

- **Frequency:** 1x/day ideal, 3-4x/week minimum
- **Best times:** 7-9pm local time, weekends
- **Cross-post:** Same video to TikTok, Reels, Shorts

### Time Investment

- **Per video:** 30-60 minutes once you have a workflow
- **Weekly:** 3-5 hours for 5-7 videos
- **Results timeline:** Unpredictable — could be 1 week or 3 months

### Recommendation

Only pursue TikTok if you enjoy making videos or have time to batch-create. It's high effort with uncertain ROI. Better as a Phase 2 channel after Reddit and Pinterest are working.

## 4. Newsletter Strategy

### Why Build a Newsletter

- **Owned audience** — doesn't depend on algorithms
- **Direct relationship** — can promote anything
- **Monetizable** — sponsorships at 5k+ subscribers
- **Compounds** — every subscriber stays (mostly)

### Newsletter Concept

**Name ideas:**
- "The Haunted Dispatch"
- "Spooky Fridays"
- "Ghost Mail"

**Format:**
Weekly email with:
1. Featured haunted place (new deep research)
2. 3 quick haunted facts
3. "This week in paranormal history"
4. Reader submissions / ghost stories

### Email Capture on SpookFinder

Add email signup to:
- Homepage (above fold)

- Exit intent popup
- Dedicated /newsletter page

**Lead magnet ideas:**
- "The 50 Most Haunted Places in America" (PDF)
- "Haunted Road Trip Planner" (PDF)
- "Ghost Hunting Checklist" (PDF)

### Growth Tactics

1. **Reddit** — "I send a weekly haunted places newsletter, link in profile"
2. **Pinterest** — Pin the lead magnet
3. **Cross-promotion** — Find other spooky newsletters, swap promos
4. **Giveaway** — "Subscribe for a chance to win ghost hunting gear"

### Tools

- **Buttondown** — Free up to 100 subscribers, simple
- **Beehiiv** — Free up to 2,500, growth features
- **ConvertKit** — Free up to 1,000, good for creators

### Time Investment

- **Setup:** 2-3 hours
- **Weekly:** 1-2 hours per issue
- **Growth timeline:** Slow — expect 6+ months to reach 1,000 subscribers
