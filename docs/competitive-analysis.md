# Competitive Analysis: Haunted Places Niche

Research conducted January 2026. Covers 10 competitors in the haunted places/paranormal tourism space.

---

## Executive Summary

The haunted places niche has three tiers of players:
1. **Directories** (HauntedPlaces.org, Haunts.com) — high traffic, ad-dependent, thin content
2. **Verticals** (HauntedRooms, HauntedHotelsOfAmerica) — focused on bookable experiences
3. **Tour Operators** (US Ghost Adventures, Ghosts & Gravestones) — own the customer, highest margins

**SpookFinder's opportunity:** Deep research quality that no competitor matches, combined with the discoverability of directories and the monetization potential of verticals.

## Competitor Profiles

### 1. HauntedPlaces.org
**URL:** https://www.hauntedplaces.org/
**Position:** Largest haunted places directory
**Scale:** 7,000+ locations worldwide

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Content** | User-submitted, thin descriptions (2-3 paragraphs) |
| **Features** | State browsing, category filters, "Near Me" geolocation, interactive map, random place button, user submissions |
| **Monetization** | AdThrive display ads |
| **Revenue Est.** | $5-15k/month (high traffic, low RPM) |
| **Weakness** | Generic content, no verification, no booking integration |

**Key Insight:** They win on quantity and SEO. Every state, every category has a page. But content quality is poor — copy-paste Wikipedia summaries.

---

### 2. Haunts.com
**URL:** https://www.haunts.com/haunted-places/
**Position:** Halloween + paranormal hybrid
**Scale:** All 50 states, mixed content

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Content** | Mix of real haunted places and commercial Halloween attractions |
| **Features** | State browsing, mobile app (iOS/Android), newsletter, blog |
| **Monetization** | Display ads, attraction listings (paid placement), newsletter sponsorships |
| **Revenue Est.** | $3-8k/month |
| **Weakness** | Cluttered, confusing mix of real vs. fake haunts |

**Key Insight:** They've diversified into Halloween attractions which brings seasonal traffic but dilutes the brand. The mobile app is interesting — most competitors don't have one.

---

### 3. HauntedUS.com
**URL:** https://hauntedus.com/
**Position:** Research-focused, quality over quantity
**Scale:** Smaller database, curated

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Content** | Vetted by paranormal investigators, emphasizes accuracy |
| **Features** | State browsing, collections, newsletter, book sales |
| **Monetization** | Wisconsin travel guide book, merchandise, display ads |
| **Revenue Est.** | $1-3k/month |
| **Weakness** | Small scale, regional focus, limited features |

**Key Insight:** Closest to SpookFinder's philosophy. They prioritize research quality but haven't scaled it. Their book sales model is interesting — they turned content into a product.

---

### 4. FrightFind.com
**URL:** https://frightfind.com/
**Position:** Halloween attraction finder with real haunts section
**Scale:** 5-162 listings per state

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Content** | Dual: commercial haunted houses + "Real Haunts" section |
| **Features** | Geolocation ("within 300 miles"), state rankings, user accounts, reviews, distance filter |
| **Monetization** | Expedia affiliate (hotels), ghost-hunting gear affiliate (Refersion), attraction listings |
| **Revenue Est.** | $2-5k/month |
| **Weakness** | Seasonal traffic spike (Halloween), "real haunts" section feels secondary |

**Key Insight:** Smart affiliate strategy — they link haunted hotels to Expedia for booking commissions. The distance filter is a great UX feature.

---

### 5. HauntedRooms.com
**URL:** https://www.hauntedrooms.com/
**Position:** Ghost hunt experiences + haunted hotels
**Scale:** Hundreds of events and hotels

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Content** | Event-focused, detailed ghost hunt descriptions |
| **Features** | Ghost hunt calendar, booking system (WooCommerce), gift cards, waitlist for sold-out events, price tiers |
| **Monetization** | **Ghost hunt tickets ($99-$798)**, hotel bookings, gift cards |
| **Revenue Est.** | $10-30k/month |
| **Weakness** | Limited geographic coverage, experience-dependent |

**Key Insight:** **Best monetization model in the space.** They don't just list places — they sell experiences. A $798 overnight ghost hunt has much better margins than display ads. Gift cards are smart for seasonality.

---

### 6. HauntedHotelsOfAmerica.com
**URL:** https://hauntedhotelsofamerica.com/
**Position:** Verified haunted hotel directory
**Scale:** 322 hotels across 50 states

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Content** | Verified backstories, guest testimonials, paranormal investigation details |
| **Features** | State browsing, FAQ section, "verified" badges |
| **Monetization** | Hotel booking affiliates, display ads |
| **Revenue Est.** | $1-3k/month |
| **Weakness** | Hotels only, no direct booking, minimal features |

**Key Insight:** The "verified" positioning is smart — builds trust. But they don't capitalize on it with direct booking or premium features.

---

### 7. HauntedHotelStays.com
**URL:** https://hauntedhotelstays.com/
**Position:** Haunted hotels by region
**Scale:** 717 hotels

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Content** | Regional organization, blog content |
| **Features** | Regional browsing (West Coast, Midwest, etc.), city highlights |
| **Monetization** | Display ads, probable booking affiliates |
| **Revenue Est.** | $500-2k/month |
| **Weakness** | Thin content, no unique features |

**Key Insight:** Regional organization is interesting for road trip planning. But execution is weak — feels like an SEO play without real value-add.

---

### 8. USGhostAdventures.com
**URL:** https://usghostadventures.com/
**Position:** Ghost tour operator + content publisher
**Scale:** 250+ cities, 4 overnight properties

| Aspect | Details |

| **Monetization** | **Tour tickets**, overnight stays ($100-300/night), merchandise, books, Kayak/hotel affiliates |
| **Revenue Est.** | $50-200k/month (they're a real tour company) |
| **Weakness** | Only covers cities where they operate |

**Key Insight:** **Best overall business model.** They own the full funnel: content attracts visitors, tours convert them, merch/books extend LTV. Their blog is SEO-optimized to capture "haunted places in [city]" searches, then funnels to tour bookings.

---

### 9. GhostsAndGravestones.com
**URL:** https://www.ghostsandgravestones.com/
**Position:** National ghost trolley tour brand
**Scale:** Major tourist cities (Savannah, St. Augustine, Boston, etc.)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Content** | "Most haunted places" lists, tour descriptions |
| **Features** | Tour booking, city pages |
| **Monetization** | **Tour tickets** (part of Historic Tours Inc.) |
| **Revenue Est.** | $1M+/year (established tour company) |
| **Weakness** | Limited to tour cities, corporate feel |

**Key Insight:** Part of Historic Tours Inc., a large tour operator. They've built a recognizable brand with the trolley concept. Shows the value of a memorable format.

---

### 10. Atlas Obscura (Haunted Category)
**URL:** https://www.atlasobscura.com/categories/haunted
**Position:** Curious travel destinations (haunted is one category)
**Scale:** 6.5M monthly users, $20M+ revenue

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Content** | Editorial quality, user contributions, professional photography |
| **Features** | Trip booking, collections, membership, podcast, books |
| **Monetization** | **Brand partnerships (60%)**, trips ($55-$3,500+), ads, books, events |
| **Revenue Est.** | $20-24M/year (2023) |
| **Weakness** | Haunted is just one category, not their focus |

**Key Insight:** Atlas Obscura is the gold standard for turning a content site into a real business. Their pivot to brand partnerships ($15M of $24M revenue) shows the value of premium positioning. They work with Land Rover, Netflix, Marriott.

## SpookFinder's Competitive Advantages

### What We Have That They Don't

| Advantage | Competitors | SpookFinder |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Research depth** | 2-3 paragraphs, Wikipedia copy | 5,000+ chars, 8-12 sources |
| **Source verification** | "Reportedly haunted" | Source counts, named references |
| **Ghost story quality** | Generic summaries | Named ghosts, specific accounts, dates |
| **Historical context** | Minimal | Full building history, tragic events |

### How to Leverage This

1. **"Deep Research" badge** — Visual indicator on thoroughly researched places
2. **Source citations** — Show the work, build trust with serious enthusiasts
3. **"Research Report" downloads** — Premium PDF for paranormal investigators
4. **Authority positioning** — "The most thoroughly researched haunted places directory"

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Display ads are table stakes, not a strategy.** Every competitor uses them. They cap out at $10-20k/month even with massive traffic.

2. **The real money is in experiences.** HauntedRooms and US Ghost Adventures make 5-10x more than pure directories by selling tickets.

3. **Affiliate is the bridge.** Hotel and tour affiliates let you monetize without operational complexity. Start here.

4. **Brand partnerships require scale and prestige.** Atlas Obscura gets $15M/year from brands, but they have 6.5M monthly users and work with Netflix/Marriott. This is a Year 2+ play.

5. **Your research quality is unique.** No competitor has 5,000+ character ghost stories with 10+ sources. This is your moat. Monetize it through authority positioning and premium content.
