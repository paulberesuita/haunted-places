Hi,

I found your paranormal websites page and noticed you link to several haunted
places directories like Haunted Places Directory and Ghost Village.

I run SpookFinder (spookfinder.com), a haunted places directory focused on
research depth. Unlike most sites, we verify each location with 8+ independent
sources and include detailed historical context, named ghosts, and specific
documented incidents.

Example: spookfinder.com/place/stanley-hotel

Thanks for all the great resources you've compiled!

## Notes

- **Follow up once** — 7 days after initial email, then move on
- **Track everything** — know what's working
- **Be patient** — link building takes time to show SEO results
